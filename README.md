## Lesson 1 Introduction to Blockchain and Layer 1

### Course

It mainly talks about how Bitcoin was born and how Ethereum operates, from execution/consensus separation to modular blockchain.

I feel like I'm dreaming back to 2017. I just came into contact with the rabbit hole of blockchain. I read the BTC/ETH white paper and read some legendary stories before 2015. Everything started with BTC, but it has branched out, and there are all kinds of new things. Ideas, new technologies emerge.

## Lesson 2 Why Scalability

### Course
Explain the architecture of each layer2

### Homework
1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum
Client diversity can improve the robustness of the entire Ethereum blockchain. For example, when a bug occurs in a certain client, other clients can run normally.

2. How would you describe the following concepts and how do you rank them in terms of their importance to you
   * TPS and transaction cost
   * Finality
   * Privacy
   * Decentralisation
   * Security
